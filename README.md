# oneFileProjects

A set of one file projects I will work randomly, without a specific goal, just for fun.

The following statement might seem reasonable for one file long projects in 2025:

**The purpose is to train myself, so any sort of copilot or assistance is prohibited by me, and my willingness to learn! Documentation from imports is valid, although for this repo I'll try avoiding dependencies as much as posible.**
